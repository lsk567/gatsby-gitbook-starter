## Pull Requests
The preferred way to contribute to Lingua Franca is to [set up Eclipse](Developer-Eclipse-Setup-with-Oomph) and the issue pull requests through GitHub.

## Code Formatting
The Lingua Franca compiler builds on the Xtext framework and is written in Java and Xtend. A more elaborate description of our code formatting conventions will follow soon, but for those who use Eclipse, readily importable code formatters are available:
* [Java](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/blob/master/JavaFormatterEclipse.xml)
* [Xtend](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/blob/master/XtendFormatterEclipse.xml)
