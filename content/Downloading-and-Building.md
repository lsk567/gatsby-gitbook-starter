# Downloading and Building

If you plan to contribute to Lingua Franca, we recommend following the [[Developer Eclipse setup with Oomph]] instructions. Otherwise, you can download a release.

In addition, if you want a Kotlin-friendly developer environment using IntelliJ, you can also follow the [[Developer IntelliJ Setup (for Kotlin)]] instructions to set it up.

You can also build and run the Lingua Franca IDE without the Eclipse setup. To run Lingua Franca IDE (Epoch) with Kotlin-based code generators enabled (which is not possible with the Eclipse setup), please see the instructions in [[Running Lingua Franca IDE (Epoch) with Kotlin based Code Generators Enabled (without Eclipse Environment)]].

Alternatively, a language plugin is available for Vim and Neovim.
It is available, as well as installation instructions, in https://github.com/lf-lang/lingua-franca.vim.
